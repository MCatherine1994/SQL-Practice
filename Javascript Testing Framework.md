## **Javascript Testing Framework**  
### **Testing Approaches**
#### **Unit Testing:**  
Individual component is in a controlled environment where programmers validate data structure, logic, and boundary condition. One simple case to test the functionality  
#### **Regression Testing:**  
Test the original functionality after making the change to make sure the changes did not effect the previous features  
#### **Business Acceptance Testing:**  
Ensure that the code meets customer requirements  
#### **Functional Testing:**  
Ensure that the code meets the funtional requirements  
#### **Integration Testing:**  
Verify that components work together integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements   

### **Introduction of the most popular five**  
#### **[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/):**  
A flexible library providing developers with just the base test structure. Functionality for assertions, spies, mocks, and the like are then added via other libraries/plugins. Requires more configurations. Behaviour Driven Development.  
#### **[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/):**  
JavaScript unit testing frameworks, comes with assertions, spies, and mocks, almost everything build-in, except snapshots. Behaviour Driven Development.  
#### **[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/):**  
Unit Testing framework for ReactJs developed by Facebook. Speed and convenience. Fast testing library due to its clever parallel testing, wrapper around Jasmine, comes with assertions, spies, mocks that are equivalent to libraries that do the same like Sinon to make testing React easier, and comes with a wide API. Less tooling and library support available compared to more mature libraries. Behaviour Driven Development.    
#### **[AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava):**  
A minimalistic testing library, takes advantage of JavaScript’s async nature and runs tests concurrently, Snapshot testing is provided via jest-snapshot. Test Driven Development.   
#### **[Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape):**  
Most minimal of all the frameworks. Test Driven Development.
